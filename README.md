**reason:**
Discounts and Flash Sales:
Alibaba hosted time-limited flash sales where customers could access substantial discounts on a wide range of products. These discounts were often exclusive to the Singles' Day event, creating urgency.
Tiered Discounts:
Some sellers offered increasing discounts as the amount spent on Alibaba's platforms grew, encouraging customers to purchase more to unlock higher discounts.
